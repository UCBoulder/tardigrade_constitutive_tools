A collection of tools useful for constitutive modeling. These tools are
intended to reduce the burden in creating a new constitutive model from
scratch enabling a faster turn-around for model development. These tools
should be as general as possible to avoid cluttering the database with
extraneous things.

## Dependencies:

### Executables

* CMake >= 3.14
* Doxygen >= 1.8.5

### Python Modules

For convenience, the minimal Python environment requirements for the
documentation build are included in ``environment.yaml`` and
``requirements.txt``. A minimal anaconda environment for building the
documentation and the python interface can be created from an existing
anaconda installation with the following commands.

```
$ conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

### Libraries

* eigen >= 3.3.7
* BOOST >= 1.53.0
* error\_tools: error_tools
* vector\_tools: vector_tools

#### "Internal" project libraries

All of the ``{error,vector}_tools`` libraries are pulled from their git repos by
branch name and built with their respective cmake files as part of the cmake
build for this project.

#### Eigen

https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen

Eigen must be "installed" following the ``eigen/INSTALL`` instructions. The
Eigen dependence is easiest to resolve if eigen is installed in the default
install directory.  However, if you don't have admin privileges, you can also
insall Eigen to your home directory in ``~/include`` (or possibly in
``~/.local/include``, but this is untested by this project).

#### Non-admin Eigen install for constitutive_tools
[Reference](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36871/where-should-a-local-executable-be-placed)

```
# (OPTIONAL) source Intel compilers. c++/g++ compilers from GNU 4.8.5 also work.
source /apps/intel2016/bin/ifortvars.sh -arch intel64 -platform linux
# Create personal include file directory
$ pwd
/home/$USER
$ mkdir .local/include
# Move to repository directory
$ cd /preferred/path/to/repos
# Example
# Clone eigen
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
$ cd eigen
$ git checkout 3.3.7
# Build eigen
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ export CXX=$(command -v icpc) # OPTIONAL
$ cmake3 .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
$ make install
```

## Build and Test

This repository is now built completely with cmake.

> **API Health Note**: The sphinx API docs are a work-in-progress. The doxygen
> API is much more useful

A build script has been created for convenience, ``new_build.sh``. It will build
everything including the library binary, the test binary, and the documentation.


### Local development

In some cases it is not convenient to pull down every repository required but it may be desired that local
versions of the repository are used. An example of when this may be needed is if development is across
multiple libraries and is proceeding faster than collaborators can check in results. In this case, and
outside of developers no-one should need to do this, a version of the code using local repositories can be
built.

1) Activate a python environment

```
$ conda activate environment
```

2) Define convenience environment variables
$ my_error_tools=/path/to/my/error_tools
$ my_vector_tools=/path/to/my/vector_tools

3) Perform the initial configuration

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DFETCH_SOURCE=LOCAL -DERROR_TOOLS_PATH=${my_error_tools} -DVECTOR_TOOLS_PATH=${my_vector_tools}
```

4) Building the library

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools/build
$ make
```

### Building the documentation

To build just the documentation pick up the steps here:

2) Create the build directory and move there

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools/
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
```

3) Run cmake3 configuration

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools/build/
$ cmake3 ..
```

4) Build the docs

```
$ cmake3 --build docs
```

5) Documentation builds to:

```
constitutive_tools/build/docs/sphinx/index.html
```

6) Display docs

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools/build/
$ firefox docs/sphinx/index.html &
```

7) While the Sphinx API is still a WIP, try the doxygen API

```
$ pwd
/path/to/constitutive_tools/build/
$ firefox docs/doxygen/html/index.html &
```
